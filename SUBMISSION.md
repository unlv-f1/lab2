1.  Give the hierarchy of the transform tree with regards to /laser,  /base_link, /map, and the /laser_model. (10pts)


2. Drive the vehicle around the map and report what the metrics & parameters are between the following transform frames, start the vehicle at  X:10, Y:0.  (20pts)

     - map and base_link
     - map and laser
     - map and laser_model
     - laser and laser_model

3. What can we infer about the transforms between the base_link and laser frame? How about the laser and laser_model? (10pts)

4.  What is the distance at degrees 0, 90 and -90 from the wall at the starting point X:10, Y:0? (20pts)

     - The laser scan (data)?
     - The laser model?

5. Change the starting position of the vehicle to  X:-10, Y:9, Theta:10. What are the new distances from the wall at degrees 0, 90 and -90 (use /scan data). (20pts)
     
     - The laser scan (data)?
     - The laser model?
